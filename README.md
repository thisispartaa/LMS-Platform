# LMS Training Platform

## Overview
This Training Platform is an internal AI-powered employee onboarding and training solution designed to improve the learning experience for both new and existing employees. The platform uses GPT-4 to read and understand uploaded documents or videos, generate summaries, create training modules based on a 4-stage learning journey, and produce AI-generated quizzes. It also includes an admin dashboard for managing modules, tracking employee progress, and sending notifications.

## Objectives

- Enable admins to manage, assign, and track training completion efficiently.
- Integrate with SharePoint for file storage and Outlook for email notifications.

## Methodology
1. Gathered requirements and created a detailed BRD in collaboration with the Lead Business Analyst.
2. Generated technical specifications and prompts for MVP creation.
3. Used Replit to build the initial MVP through prompt-based no-code development.
4. Optimized and debugged the generated code using Cursor.
5. Integrated GPT-4 for:
   - Summarizing uploaded files in laymanâ€™s terms.
